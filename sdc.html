								<h2>Skill Development Courses (SDCs)</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The club offers a veriety of SDCs. These are both benificial to you as a diver, but also help the club to run more adventurous trips. If you have attended a skills development course with another agency (PADI, RYA etc) and BSAC recognises it you can apply for a certificate of alternative training.</p>

							<h2>Oxygen Administration</h2>
							<p>The administration of oxygen is the main first aid treatment for Decompression Illness (DCI). This course and Practical Rescue Management (PRM) are arguably the most valuable skill development courses available to BSAC divers as the skills you learn could potentially save someoneâ€™s life. The Oxygen Administration course takes one day and is open to BSAC Ocean Divers and above. Over the course of the day you will learn how to effectively administer O<sub>2</sub> using the club shore and boat kits. The course also covers theory lessons 2 - 7 of the Dive Leader course.</p>
							<p>The course includes:
								<ul class="style_resources">
									<li>Revision of AV/CPR</li>
									<li>Use of Pocket Mask</li>
									<li>Oxygen and Diving Accidents (Conditions and Symptoms)</li>
									<li>Casualty Examination</li>
									<li>Oxygen Administration Equipment</li>
									<li>Oxygen Administration in Practice</li>
									<li>Use of Oxygen Equipment</li>
									<li>Positive Pressure Ventilation</li>
									<li>Theory Assessment</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>Once you have completed this course you are qualified to administer O2 to a diver if required.</p>

							<h3>Boat Handling</h3>

							<p>The club owns two Zodiac Inflatable boats equipped with outboard motors. They are light, powerful and allow the club to extend operations away from the shore which is crucial for diving. The course is very hands-on with at least 2 hours of high and low speed driving in the sea.</p>
							<p>What you&#39;ll learn:
								<ul class="style_resources">
									<li>Familiarisation with the boat and its equipment - GPS, Ultrasound, Outboard Engine</li>
									<li>Owner and driver responsibilities</li>
									<li>Boat handling skills - Operating a boat, launching/loading and retrieval</li>
									<li>Voyage planning - weather, tides, area familiarity, crew and 'get home' plan</li>
									<li>Sheltered and open water handling</li>
									<li>Anchoring and diving</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>This course is 2 days long and is open to all UBUC members. No diving qualification is needed to do this course. Cost is approximately &pound;100 per student. You will need a dry-suit/waterproof clothing.</p>

									<li>Fault finding for engine problems</li>
									<li>Engine care and maintenance</li>
									<li>Care and maintenance of typical RIB and trailer</li>
								</ul>

							<h3>Underwater Photography</h3>
							<p>Is this still offered?</p>

							<h3>Practical Rescue Management</h3>

							<p>PRM is a one day course which and is needed to become a DL. The course is open to Sports Divers and above.</p>

							<p>The course will help you learn how to manage a rescue situation. The main focus of the day is to cover different rescue scenarios from DCI to sea sickness. The course covers practical aspects of a rescue as well as diagnosis of symptoms, recovery of a casualty, basic life saving treatment and evacuation by the emergency services (ambulance / helicopter).</p>

							<h2>PRM as Part of Dive Leader Training</h2>

							<p>You do not need separate notes as they are included in the DL lecture notes. The theory has been covered in the DL lectures. This session is equivalent to DT9, 10, 11 and DO5.</p>

							<h2>PRM as an SDC</h2>

							<p>You will need to get SDC notes from the person organising the PRM. Contact the Committee if you're not sure who they are. You will need to attend separate theory lessons.</p>

							<h3>Nitrox Blending</h3>
							<p>text to come</p>

							<h3>Advanced Nitrox and Deco Procedures</h3>

							<p>This course will be through Professional Scuba Association (PSA). Minimum entry requirement is Dive Leader. This qualifies you to use nitrox as a bottom mix to extend dive times and richer mixes for deco. Includes using twin sets, side mounts and making deco stops to a maximum depth of 45m. It requires some home study, theory lesson, theory exam and 4 dives over 3 days. Cost is &pound;110 for the student material and certification fees. Whilst much of the equipment needed can be assembled from club kit and bits I have spare, you may have to borrow from others or invest in some kit for the course.</p>

							<h3>Deco Procedures</h3>

							<p>DECO PROCEDURES crossover from TDI. For those who have previously done the TDI AN course, the PSA course covers more about deco procedures and includes theory of accelerated deco. For most divers, a crossover course is more appropriate than Extended Range. It requires some home study and theory as above and 2 dives over 2 days. Cost is &pound;70 for the student material and certification fees.</p>

							<h3>Extended Range</h3>

							<p>Like the AN and Deco Procedures, but more so, with emphasis on depth, longer dives and accelerated decompression schedules. If you are serious enough to want to do this, you will be expected to have all your own kit. It requires some home study, theory lesson, theory exam and 6 dives over 4 days. Cost is &pound;150.</p>

							<p>THEORY SESSIONS WILL BE HELD PRIOR TO THE SKOMER TRIP, AND ALL THEORY WORK AND EXAMS WILL NEED TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY OPEN WATER TRAINING TAKES PLACE.</p>
