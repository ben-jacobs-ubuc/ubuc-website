								<h2>Membership &amp; Costs</h2>
							</header>
							<p>To join UBUC all you need to do is fill in a <a href="http://www.ubuc.org/uploads/files/club/BSAC_Medical_Form.pdf" target="_blank">medical form</a> and purchase membership. Joining UBUC is by far the cheapest way to learn and dive. This page lists what you&#39;ll need to start diving with us. There are three memberships to buy if you want to dive with us:</p>
							<ul class="style_bullet">
								<li><strong>UBUC</strong>: This is essential to the survival of our club. Membership forms a large part of our revenue, which we invest to make your diving cheaper and safer.</li>
								<li><strong>Athletic Union</strong>: All sports clubs are part of the Athletic Union. The AU contributes to a large part of our funding through various grants.</li>
								<li><strong>BSAC</strong>: To be able to go diving in open water you will need a BSAC membership for insurance cover.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>These costs are spread out across the year so you don&#39;t have to buy everything at once.</p>

							<h2>Membership Fees</h2>
							<ul class="style_bullet">
								<li>Student Member: &pound;40</li>
								<li>Non-Student Member: &pound;50</li>
								<li>Free Diving / Snorkelling Member: &pound;10</li><br>
							</ul>

							<h2>Athletic Union Membership</h2>
							<p>UBUC is affiliated to the Athletic Union, the governing body for the sports clubs of the University of Bristol. The AU membership is compulsory for all sports clubs, however only needs to be paid once for all clubs you decide to join.</p>
							<p>The AU Membership is &pound;20 for the 2013/14 period.</p>
							<p>Non-Students will additionally need to purchase an Associate University of Bristol Union membership to access Union facilities and for insurance purposes. Associate Membership is &pound;25.</p><br>


							<h2>BSAC Membership</h2>
							<p>The British Sub-Aqua Club is the governing body for underwater activities in the UK. It provides its members with third party insurance cover. All UBUC members need to be members of BSAC before they venture out into open water.</p>
							<p>BSAC Membership is currently &pound;28 for students. BSAC membership is organised by the Secretary at the beginning of March, when most of our members renew their membership. For more information visit the <a href="http://www.bsac.com/page.asp?section=1160&sectionTitle=Membership+Rates" target="_blank">BSAC website</a>.</p><br>


							<h2>Paying Your Membership</h2>
							<p>You can pay both your UBUC and AU membership online through the Union website, whether you are a student or not. To pay online, follow these steps:</p>
							<ol class="style_bullet">
								<li>Go to http://www.ubu.org.uk/login/</li>
								<li>Students can log-in with their UoB username and password. Non-students need to register an account</li>
								<li>Once logged in go to <a href="http://ubu.org.uk/activities/sports/7589/" target="_blank"></a>http://ubu.org.uk/activities/sports/7589/</li>
								<li>Choose the correct type of membership and click 'Add to Basket'</li>
								<li>Go to your basket and add Sport &amp; Health (AU) membership if required. This is a one-off payment for all sports clubs</li>
								<li>Click on 'Go to Checkout' and follow the Sage Pay instructions to pay by card</li>
								<li>Once you have paid your club membership will appear in the membership list in the 'Your Profile' section</li>
							</ol><br>


							<h2>Basic Kit</h2>
							<p>To start training in the pool you will need basic training kit: mask, fins, wetsuit boots and snorkel (and a swimming costume too!). UBUC can't provide these as they need to be specific to you (faces are different shapes and feet different sizes).</p>
							<p>Basic pool training kit costs &pound;70-120 new depending on what brand you buy. More information can be found on the equipment page.</p><br>


							<h2>Training Materials</h2>
							<p>To train with us you will need to purchase BSAC training materials which include a textbook, lecture notes, qualification book and your qualification card.</p>
							<p>Training material costs around &pound;40, depending on the qualification. We can order the packs for you, usually at the start of your training.</p>
							<p>For up-to-date information on training pack costs visit the BSAC website.</p><br>


							<h2>Other Kit</h2>
							<p>Diving is equipment intensive, but you knew that already! In addition to basic kit, for the open sea you will need a buy/rent a suit, gloves, and a hood. The prices of these vary widely depending on what you buy, but as a rough guide a new wetsuit suitable for UK waters costs around &pound;150.</p>
							<p>If you are on a budget, eBay and second-hand equipment from older members are the way forward. If you need any advice on what suit will keep you warm in the UK read our equipment pages.</p><br>
