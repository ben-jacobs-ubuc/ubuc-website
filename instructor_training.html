								<h2>Instructor Training</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The first step to becoming an Instructor is to attend an Instructor Foundation Course (IFC) which you can do once you have acheived your Sports Diver Qualification and will allow to teach in the Pool. The next step is to start teaching in the pool and go diving to become a dive leader as this will alllow you to become either a practical or theory Instructor.</p>

							<p>To become a Theory Instructor you need to pass a Theory Instructor Exam (TIE). Once passed it allows you to give lectures for trainees. To become a Practical Open Water Instructor you need to attend an Open Water Instructor Course and pass a Practical Instructor Exam (PIE). Once passed it allows you to take and teach trainees in the sea.</p>

							<p>Once you pass both the PIE and the TIE you are a Nationally Qualified Instructor (NQI) and can teach both practical and theory.</p>

							<p>As an added incentive if you are actively instructing with the club you can claim back part of the cost of the IFC, OWIC, PIE and TIE.</p>

							<p>If you have an instructing qualification from another agency, that is recognised by BSAC, you can easily cross over. All you need to do is attend an IFC.</p><br>


							<h3>Instructor Foundation Course (IFC)</h3>

							<p>The first step on the way to becoming an instructor is to attend an Instructor Foundation Course. This is a two day course run, usually run over the weekend, with half the time spent in lectures and small group sessions and the other half spent in the pool. On the first day you will get a title for a 10 minute classroom presentation and a pool lesson to be given the next day. But remember this isn't a pass/fail assessment, it's a course preparing you for the next step in becoming an instructor.</p>

							<p>IFCs tend to be run in the same places and the nearest venues to Bristol are Exeter and Worcester. You can check the <a href="http://www.bsac.com/courses.asp?section=1359" target="_blank">BSAC website</a> for upcoming courses. Once you've completed an IFC you are a sheltered water Assistant Instructor so you can teach in the pool under the supervision of a Nationally Qualified Instructor (NQI). If you are actively instructing then you can claim back half of the cost of the IFC (speak to the <a href="committee.html">treasurer</a>).</p><br>


							<h3>Theory Instructor Exam (TIE)</h3>

							<p>The TIE is comprised of three separate elements:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>A 10 minute Classroom presentation</li>
								<li>A 1 hour (60 question) multiple choice answer Exam Paper </li>
								<li>A 45 minute Practical Assessment</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Hints &amp; Tips for the Presentation</h2>
							<p>As soon as you get the topic for your presentation, start thinking about it and crack on with it ASAP.</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t try to teach the entire topic given. This runs the risks of teaching beyond the knowledge of the target audience and/or making you run overtime. Pick a small part of a subject and teach that well.<br>e.g. Buoyancy: Why not get your BCD out and discuss its features and use, or compare it to others that you may be able to borrow. This could be instead of discussing the laws of physics and explaining what they are all about! By the reverse logic, pick a subject and DONâ€™T brief over it.</p>

							<p>Try to pull most of the information from the Instructor Manual.</p>

							<h2>Topics</h2>
							<ul class="style_resources">
								<li>Buoyancy: Can use your BCD or &#39;Physics of Buoyancy&#39;</li>
								<li>Dive Computers</li>
								<li>DCI: Can be broken down into Signs and Symptoms, First Aid or Prevention</li>
								<li>Wreck Diving: Penetration, Dangers &amp; Navigation; How to research and get information on wrecks or equipment to use whilst wreck diving</li>
								<li>Risk Assessments: Can use SEEDS as a basis (pages 108 and 129 of Instructor brochure may be of help)</li>
								<li>SMBs &amp; DSMB: The different types (can use real thing as Visual Aids)</li>
								<li>Compass Navigation: You could get the students to practice use of a compass in the class, but ensure you have set the room up to accommodate this</li>
								<li>AAS: Reasons for having them, different types (could use real things as visual aids)</li>
								<li>Circulation</li>
								<li>The Ear</li>
								<li>Drift Diving: Could use SMB (i.e. reasons why you need one), profiles, buddy-lines</li>
								<li>Decompression Tables: Be careful not to turn this into a list of definitions</li>
								<li>Charts - Symbols (could use chart 5011)</li>
								<li>Diving Diseases</li>
								<li>Deep Diving</li>
								<li>Rescue Techniques and Processes (important to check on what is current information)</li>
								<li>Nitrogen Narcosis</li>
								<li>Tides: Explanation of Tides, Rule of Twelves and/or Tidal Curves</li>
							</ul>
							<p>When you've got the gist of your topic, scribble out your visual aids.</p>

							<p>Rehearse your subject and give your lecture to your diving friends to ensure you have got it right and that your timings are good. It also gets you used to talking in front of people and they could give you advice on what is good or may be going wrong, so that you can sort it out before the big day.</p>
